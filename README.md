# vue-frontend-basics

The code modified after using `vue create` is shown [here](https://github.com/j3soon/vue-frontend-basics/commit/67b37eb86c745b7a5995c22ef85766f962d1d756). If you look at the html template and javascript, you can know how to do basic two-way bindings using `v-bind`, `v-on`, the css part can be ignored, I didn't put a lot of effort on it.

After learning the binding basics, see [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) if you needs deep-bindings or bindings that acts like global variables.
